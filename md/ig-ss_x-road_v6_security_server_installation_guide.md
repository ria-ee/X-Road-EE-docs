It is strongly recommended to protect the security server from unwanted access using a firewall (hardware or software based). The firewall can be applied to both incoming and outgoing connections depending on the security requirements of the environment where the security server is deployed. It is recommended to allow incoming traffic to specific ports only from explicitly defined sources using IP filtering. **Special attention should be paid with the firewall configuration since incorrect configuration may leave the security server vulnerable to exploits and attacks.**

 #### 2.2.1 Network Diagram
 The following network diagram is an example of a simple stand-alone Security Server setup. Attention should be paid when configuring the firewall of your Security Server, as misconfigurations (e.g. exposing port 80/tcp to the public internet) can leave your server vulnerable. **IP whitelisting should be used for all ports that are open to the external network.**
 
 Allowing incoming connections from the Monitoring Security Server on ports 5500/tcp and 5577/tcp ([monitoring server IP's](#231-ria-ips-for-whitelisting)) is necessary for the X-Road Center to be able to monitor the ecosystem and provide statistics and support for Members.


 **Caution**: The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide.

### 2.3 Requirements for the Security Server

Minimum recommended hardware parameters:

* the server’s hardware (motherboard, CPU, network interface cards, storage system) must be supported by Ubuntu in general;
* a 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended;
* 3 GB RAM;
* a 100 Mbps network interface card;
* if necessary, interfaces for the use of hardware tokens.

Requirements to software and settings:

* an installed and configured Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x86-64 operating system;
* if the security server is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the security server are allowed (**reference data: 1.4; 1.5; 1.6; 1.7**). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide;
* if the security server has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (**reference data: 1.9**).


### 2.4 Preparing OS

* Add system user (**reference data: 1.3**) whom all roles in the user interface are granted to. Add a new user with the command

        sudo adduser <username>

    User roles are discussed in detail in X-Road Security Server User Guide \[[UG-SS](#Ref_UG-SS)\].

* Set the operating system locale. Add following line to the `/etc/environment` file.

        LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

* Ensure that the packages `locales` and `software-properties-common` are present

        sudo apt-get install locales software-properties-common

* Ensure that the locale is available

        sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8


### 2.5 Installation

To install the X-Road security server software on *Ubuntu* operating system, follow these steps.

1. Add to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xroad.list the address of X-Road package repository (reference data: 1.1) and the nginx repository:

        deb http://x-tee.ee/packages/live/xroad bionic main

2.  Add the X-Road repository’s signing key to the list of trusted keys (**reference data: 1.2**):

        curl http://x-tee.ee/packages/live/xroad/repo.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        
3. (Optional step) If you want to use remote database server instead of the default locally installed one, you need to pre-create a configuration file containing the database administrator master password. This can be done by performing the following steps:

        sudo touch /etc/xroad.properties
        sudo chown root:root /etc/xroad.properties
        sudo chmod 600 /etc/xroad.properties
        
    Edit `/etc/xroad.properties` contents. See the example below. Replace parameter values with your own.
    ```
    postgres.connection.password = {database superuser password}
    postgres.connection.user = {database superuser name, postgres by default}
    ```
    * If Microsoft Azure database for PostgreSQL is used, the connection user needs to be in format `username@servername`.
    * One should verify that the version of the local PostgreSQL client matches the version of the remote PostgreSQL server.

4. Issue the following commands to install the security server packages (use package xroad-securityserver-ee to include configuration specific to Estonia; use package xroad-securityserver-fi to include configuration specific to Finland):

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install xroad-securityserver-ee

Upon the first installation of the packages, the system asks for the following information.

* Account name for the user who will be granted the rights to perform all activities in the user interface (**reference data: 1.3**).
* Database server URL. Locally installed database is suggested as default but remote databases can be used as well. In case remote database is used, one should verify that the version of the local PostgreSQL client matches the version of the remote PostgreSQL server.
* The Distinguished Name of the owner of the **user interface's and management REST API's** self-signed TLS certificate (*Subject DN*) and its alternative names (*subjectAltName*) (**reference data: 1.8; 1.10**). The certificate is used for securing connections to the user interface and to the management REST APIs.
  The name and IP addresses detected from the operating system are suggested as default values.

  * The *Subject DN* must be entered in the format:

            /CN=server.domain.tld

  * All IP addresses and domain names in use must be entered as alternative names in the format:

            IP:1.2.3.4,IP:4.3.2.1,DNS:servername,DNS:servername2.domain.tld

* The Distinguished Name of the owner of the TLS certificate that is used for securing the HTTPS access point of information systems (**reference data: 1.8; 1.11**).
    The name and IP addresses detected from the system are suggested as default values.

    * The *Subject DN* must be entered in the format:

            /CN=server.domain.tld

    * All IP addresses and domain names in use must be entered as alternative names in the format:

            IP:1.2.3.4,IP:4.3.2.1,DNS:servername,DNS:servername2.domain.tld

The meta-package `xroad-securityserver` also installs metaservices module `xroad-addon-metaservices`, messagelog module `xroad-addon-messagelog` and WSDL validator module `xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator`. Both meta-packages `xroad-securityserver-ee` and `xroad-securityserver-fi` install operational data monitoring module `xroad-addon-opmonitoring`.

**N.B.** In case configuration specific to Estonia (package `xroad-securityserver-ee`) is installed, connections from client applications are restricted to localhost by default. To enable client application connections from external sources, the value of the `connector-host` property must be overridden in the `/etc/xroad/conf.d/local.ini` configuration file. Changing the system parameter values is explained in the System Parameters User Guide \[[UG-SS](#Ref_UG-SS)\].

### 2.6 Post-Installation Checks

The installation is successful if system services are started and the user interface is responding.

* Ensure from the command line that X-Road services are in the `running` state (example output follows):
    ```
    sudo systemctl list-units "xroad*"

    UNIT                     LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
    xroad-confclient.service loaded active running X-Road confclient
    xroad-monitor.service    loaded active running X-Road Monitor
    xroad-proxy-ui-api.service loaded active running X-Road Proxy UI REST API
    xroad-proxy.service      loaded active running X-Road Proxy
    xroad-signer.service     loaded active running X-Road signer
    ```
* Ensure that the security server user interface at https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/ (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**) can be opened in a Web browser. To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3**). While the user interface is still starting up, the Web browser may display the “502 Bad Gateway” error.

-   Ensure that the security server user interface at https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/ (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**) can be opened in a Web browser. To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3**). While the user interface is still starting up, the Web browser may display the “502 Bad Gateway” error.

### 2.7 Installing the Support for Hardware Tokens

To configure support for hardware security tokens (smartcard, USB token, Hardware Security Module), act as follows.

1.  Install the hardware token support module using the following command:

        sudo apt-get install xroad-addon-hwtokens

2.  Install and configure a PKCS\#11 driver for the hardware token according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3.  Add the path to the PKCS\#11 driver to the file `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` (as described in the example given in the file).

4.  After installing and configuring the driver, the `xroad-signer` service must be restarted:

        sudo service xroad-signer restart

If you are running a high availability (HA) hardware token setup (such as a cluster with replicated tokens) then you may need to constrain the token identifier format such that the token replicas can be seen as the same token. The token identifier format can be changed in `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` via the `token_id_format` property (default value: `{moduleType}{slotIndex}{serialNumber}{label}`). Removing certain parts of the identifier will allow the HA setup to work correctly when one of the tokens goes down and is replaced by a replica. For example, if the token replicas are reported to be on different slots the `{slotIndex}` part should be removed from the identifier format.

Depending on the hardware token there may be a need for more additional configuration. All possible configurable parameters in the `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` are described in the next table.

Parameter   | Type    | Default Value | Explanation
----------- | ------- |-------------- | ---------------------------------------
*enabled*     | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether this device is enabled.

### 2.8 Installing the Support for Environmental Monitoring

The support for environmental monitoring functionality on a security server is provided by package xroad-monitor that is installed by default. The package installs and starts the `xroad-monitor` process that will gather and make available the monitoring information.

### 2.9 Remote Database Post-Installation Tasks

Local PostgreSQL is always installed with Security Server. When remote database host is used, the local PostgreSQL can be stopped and disabled after the installation.

To stop the local PostgreSQL server

`systemctl stop postgresql`

To disable the local PostgreSQL server so that it does not start automatically when the server is rebooted.

`systemctl mask postgresql`


## 3 Security Server Initial Configuration

During the security server initial configuration, the server’s X-Road membership information and the software token’s PIN are set.


### 3.1 Prerequisites

Configuring the security server assumes that the security server owner is a member of the X-Road.


### 3.2 Reference Data

ATTENTION: Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 in the reference data are provided to the security server owner by the X-Road central’s administrator.

The security server code and the software token’s PIN will be determined during the installation at the latest, by the person performing the installation.

 Ref  |                                                   | Explanation
 ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 2.1  | <https://x-tee.ee/anchors/>&lt;anchor file&gt;<br> ee-dev - development environment<br> ee-test - test environment<br> EE - production environment | Global configuration anchor file
 2.2  | GOV - government<br> COM - commercial<br> NGO - non-profit<br> NEE - not Estonian | Member class of the security server's owner
 2.3  | &lt;security server owner register code&gt;       | Member code of the security server's owner
 2.4  | &lt;choose security server identificator name&gt; | Security server's code
 2.5  | &lt;choose PIN for software token&gt;             | Software token’s PIN


### 3.3 Configuration

To perform the initial configuration, open the address

    https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/

in a Web browser (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**). To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3).**

Upon first log-in, the system asks for the following information.

* The global configuration anchor file (**reference data: 2.1**).

    **Please verify anchor hash value with the published value.**

If the configuration is successfully downloaded, the system asks for the following information.

* The security server owner’s member class (**reference data: 2.2**).
* The security server owner’s member code (**reference data: 2.3**).

-   The security server owner’s member code (**reference data: 2.3**).
    If the member class and member code are correctly entered, the system displays the security server owner’s name as registered in the X-Road center.
    - **NB! If the security server owner  or hosted client is a foreign organization (not Estonian), then the "NEE" Member Class must be selected in the security server.**

        The Member Code must be formed as follows:

        **"NTRCONTRYCODE-ORGANIZATIONREGISTRYCODE"** - without whitespaces

        Where:
        * "NTR" - Prefix of the legal entity identifier according to ETSI EN 319 412-1 clause 5.1.4.
        * COUNTRY CODE - Country code according to ISO 3166 (Alpha 2)
        * `-` hyphen
        * ORGANIZATION REGISTRY CODE - Organizational registry code in the organization's country.

        Example:
        * Lexbyte Digital Limited, a registered organization in Malta
        * Member Name: **Lexbyte Digital Limited**
        * Member Class: **NEE**
        * Member Code: **NTRMT-C56249**

        Such requirements to the NEE Member Code are necessary to ensure the uniqueness of the Member Code of foreign organizations on X-Road (X-tee). In addition, the Member Code of X-Road members must correspond to the Organization Identifier (2.5.4.97) field in the SK ID Solutions AS e-Seal certificate profile.

        References:
        * SK ID Solutions AS certificate profile: https://sk.ee/upload/files/SK-CPR-KLASS3-EN-v8_0-20171130.pdf

        * Alpha 2 country code: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search  

*   Security server code (**reference data: 2.4**), which is chosen by the security server administrator and which has to be unique across all the security servers belonging to the same X-Road member.

*   Software token’s PIN (**reference data: 2.5**). The PIN will be used to protect the keys stored in the software token. The PIN must be stored in a secure place, because it will be no longer possible to use or recover the private keys in the token once the PIN has been lost.


## 4 Installation Error handling


### 4.1 Cannot Set LC\_ALL to Default Locale

If running the locale command results in the error message

    locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory,

then the support for this particular language has not been installed. To install it, run the command (the example uses the English language):

    sudo apt-get install language-pack-en

Then, to update the system’s locale files, run the following commands (the example uses the US locale):

    sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    sudo update-locale en_US.UTF-8

Set operating system locale. Add following line to `/etc/environment` file:

    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

After updating the system’s locale settings, it is recommended to restart the operating system.


### 4.2 PostgreSQL Is Not UTF8 Compatible

If the security server installation is aborted with the error message

    postgreSQL is not UTF8 compatible,

then the PostgreSQL package is installed with a wrong locale. One way to resolve it is to remove the data store created upon the PostgreSQL installation and recreate it with the correct encoding.

**WARNING**: All data in the database will be erased!

    sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 10 main
    LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" sudo pg_createcluster --start 10 main

To complete the interrupted installation, run the command

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.3 Could Not Create Default Cluster

If the following error message is displayed during PostgreSQL installation:

    Error: The locale requested by the environment is invalid.
    Error: could not create default cluster. Please create it manually with pg_createcluster 10 main –start,

use the following command to create the PostgreSQL data cluster:

    LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" sudo pg_createcluster --start 10 main

The interrupted installation can be finished using

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.4 Is Postgres Running On Port 5432?

If the following error message appears during installation

    Is postgres running on port 5432 ?
    Aborting installation! please fix issues and rerun with apt-get -f install,

check if any of the following errors occurred during the installation of PostgreSQL.

* Error installing the data cluster. Refer to section [“Could not create default cluster”](#43-could-not-create-default-cluster).

* The PostgreSQL data cluster installed during the installation of the security server is not configured to listen on port 5432. To verify and configure the listening port, edit the PostgreSQL configuration file in `/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf`. If you change the listening port, the postgresql service must be restarted.

The interrupted installation can be finished using

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.5 Different versions of xroad-\* packages after successful upgrade

Sometimes, after using `sudo apt-get upgrade` command, some of the packages are not upgraded. In the following example `xroad-securityserver-ee` package version is still 6.8.3 although other packages are upgraded to 6.8.5:

    # sudo dpkg -l | grep xroad-
    ii xroad-addon-messagelog 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-addon-metaservices 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-common 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-jetty9 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-proxy 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-securityserver-ee 6.8.3-3-201605131138

`apt-get upgrade` command doesn’t install new packages - in this particular case new packages `xroad-monitor` and `xroad-addon-proxymonitor` installation is needed for upgrade of `xroad-securityserver` package.

To be sure that packages are installed correctly please use `sudo apt upgrade` or `sudo apt full-upgrade` commands.
