<p>X-Road system parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Internal configuration</strong> – is distributed by a configuration source and is composed of the following configuration parts: private parameters; shared parameters, and; optionally, other configuration parts that are specific to an X-Road instance – optional parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring Parameters</strong> – Set of parameters that control monitoring of security servers</p>
<p><strong>Optional parameters</strong> – is an optional configuration part that carries system parameters that have a contextual meaning only to a specific X-Road system installation.</p>
<p><strong>Private parameters</strong> – is a configuration part that holds system parameters that are only used by security servers that are part of the local X-Road system (i.e. the same X-Road system as the central server the configuration part originates from). In case of federated X-Road systems, the private parameters contain configuration anchors pointing to configuration sources distributing external configuration of federation partners.</p>
<p><strong>Shared parameters</strong> – is a configuration part that holds system parameters that are used both by the security servers of the local X-Road system and by the security servers belonging to X-Road systems federated with the local system.</p>
<p><strong>Trusted anchor</strong> – is a configuration anchor that points to the external configuration source of a federation partner and has been uploaded to the central server during the federation process. Trusted anchors are distributed to the configuration clients of the local X-Road system as a part of private parameters.</p>
